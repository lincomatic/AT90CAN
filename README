AT90CAN Support for Arduino
Maintainer: Sam C. Lin <lincomatic@hotmail.com>

This is a continuation of SuperCow's work on adapting Arduino to work with AT90CANxx MCU's at http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,8446.0.html

Compile Arduino sketches on Atmel AT90CANxx MCU's.
Supports USBtinyISP and JTAG ICE mk1

For Arduino <= 0023: copy the 0023/at90can folder to <arduino>/hardware/at90can
For Arduino >= 1.0: copy the 1.0/at90can folder to <arduino>/hardware/at90can

From the Arduino IDE's Tools->Board menu, select either

[usbtinyisp]AT90CAN128

or

[JTAG ICE mk1]AT90CAN128

Set your fuses with avrdude:
avrdude -c usbtiny -p at90can128  -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m
avrdude -c usbtiny -p at90can128  -U hfuse:w:0x19:m
avrdude -c usbtiny -p at90can128  -U efuse:w:0xFF:m

To install bootloader for programming over serial, you must set in hfuse BOOTSZ=10 and BOOTRST=0. Use the following fuse settings:
avrdude -c usbtiny -p at90can128  -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m
avrdude -c usbtiny -p at90can128  -U hfuse:w:0x1C:m
avrdude -c usbtiny -p at90can128  -U efuse:w:0xFF:m
You will also need to set up the automatic reset circuit to use DTR to toggle the RESET pin:  DTR---|100nF|--<RESET>--|1n4148>|--VCC
Select [bootloader]AT90CAN128 board type in Arduino IDE and burn the bootloader.
Thereafter, you can burn sketches without a hardware programmer via USART0 (RXD0/TXD0) by selecting board type [bootloader]AT90CAN128.
